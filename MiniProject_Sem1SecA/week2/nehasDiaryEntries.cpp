/*Problem 1: Reverse the Array (Neha’s Diary Entries)
🧩 Problem Story:

Neha keeps a diary of her daily exercise times (in minutes).
She wants to review her progress, but she prefers to see the latest day’s record first.

Write a program to help Neha reverse the order of her recorded exercise times.

✅ Task:

Given n numbers representing Neha’s daily exercise time, print them in reverse order.

🧠 Input Format:

The first line contains an integer n — the number of days.

The second line contains n space-separated integers representing exercise times.
Output Format:

Print the exercise times in reverse order on a single line separated by spaces.

🧩 Example 1:

Input
5
10 20 30 40 50

Output
50 40 30 20 10*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of days: ";
    cin >> n;

    int arr[n];
    cout << "Enter the times of " << n << "days : ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++)
    {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[n - i - 1];
        arr[n - i - 1] = temp;
    }
    cout << "excersised time: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
