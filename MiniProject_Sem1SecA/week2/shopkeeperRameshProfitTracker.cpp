/*Problem Title: Shopkeeper Ramesh’s Profit Tracker 💰
🧩 Story:

Ramesh owns a small grocery shop in his town.
He keeps a record of his daily profit or loss for a week in an array.

If the value is positive, it means he made a profit that day.

If the value is negative, it means he had a loss that day.

At the end of the week, Ramesh wants to know:

His total profit (sum of all positive values)

His total loss (sum of all negative values, as a positive number)

His net balance (profit + loss, considering signs)

Help Ramesh write a program to calculate these values.

Problem Statement:

Given an array records[] of size n, where each element represents the daily profit or loss,
find and print the total profit, total loss, and net balance.

Input Format:

The first line contains an integer n — number of days.

The second line contains n space-separated integers representing profit or loss on each day.

Output Format:

Print three lines:

Total Profit: X
Total Loss: Y
Net Balance: Z


Where:

X → sum of all positive numbers

Y → sum of all negative numbers converted to positive value

Z → X − Y*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of days: ";
    cin >> n;

    int records[n];

    cout << "Enter " << n << " profit/loss values (positive for profit, negative for loss): ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cin >> records[i];
    }
    int totalProfit = 0;
    int totalLoss = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if (records[i] > 0)
            totalProfit += records[i];
        else if (records[i] < 0)
            totalLoss += (-records[i]); // make neg val pos
    }
    int netBalance = totalProfit - totalLoss;

    cout << "Total Profit: " << totalProfit << endl;
    cout << "Total Loss: " << totalLoss << endl;
    cout << "Net Balance: " << netBalance << endl;

    return 0;
}
